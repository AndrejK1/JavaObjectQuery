**Object Query**

Simple project to perform SQL-like operations on Java Objects.
Contains MapQuery implementation for manipulating Java maps.
The implementation is pure and don't mutate input data.

The idea came from a task given to my friend.
I thought it would be fun to implement it myself.

The project runs on Java 21.
